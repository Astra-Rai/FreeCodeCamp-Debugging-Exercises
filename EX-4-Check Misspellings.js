//Instructions
/*Fix the two spelling errors in the code so the netWorkingCapital calculation works

//Before
let receivables = 10;
let payables = 8;
let netWorkingCapital = recievables - payable;
console.log(`Net working capital is: ${netWorkingCapital}`);

*/

//After

let receivables = 10;//
let payables = 8;
let netWorkingCapital = receivables - payables;
//corrected spelling of receivable, letters "e and i" transposed
//added 's' to word payable
//corrected spelling of networking
console.log(`Networking capital is: ${netWorkingCapital}`);//->"Networking capital is: 2"
